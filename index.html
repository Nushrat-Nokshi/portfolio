    <h3>I Wanna Be A Good BUSINESS-WOMEN</h3>
    
    <P>The phrase women in business covers the participation of women in leadership roles in commerce.
       Women have historically been kept out of leadership roles within business. 
       Today, women fill more corporate leadership and entrepreneurship roles than ever before.
       Nigeria is the leading economy in Africa right now and its an exciting place to be a woman entrepreneur.
       The number of women-owned businesses increased nearly
       3,000% since 1972 according to the "2018 State of Women-Owned Businesses Report" commissioned by American Express.

        <h3>MY Dream- I Wish To Be A Good PROGRAMMER</h3>
        
    <P>
        
         A computer programmer, sometimes called a software developer, a programmer or more recently a coder (especially in more informal contexts),
         is a person who creates computer software.
         The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers or to a generalist who writes computer programs.
         A programmer's most often-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, Java) may be prefixed to the term programmer.
         Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web. 
                
    </P>
